## Description

This application allows users to interact through a blogging infrastructure. This website has user logging capabilites and tracks user input to posts and comments, organizing content on the dashboard.

## Progress

I was able to create a foundation for the user input and a database for everything being used on the site, however had trouble figuring out how to render changes and updates to the DOM. I was able to render the login page and welcome page, however I still am having trouble on how to connect the db to the frontend. The next update would be capturing the post and entering it into the database.
